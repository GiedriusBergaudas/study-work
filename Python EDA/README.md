# Coursera Courses Analysis
This project analyzes Coursera courses, focusing on course difficulty levels, student enrollment, course ratings, and the most popular courses. The purpose is to understand what factors may contribute to course popularity and how students engage with different course types.

## Project Description
The analysis explores:

The distribution of courses by difficulty.

The average number of students enrolled based on course difficulty.

Course ratings by difficulty level.

The most/least popular individual courses by student count.

Whether there is a correlation between course ratings and student enrollment.

## Data Source

## Tools Used
Python

Pandas

Matplotlib 

Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook

## Key Findings
- Most courses are Beginner level (54.7%), while Advanced courses are very few (2.1%).
This shows Coursera mainly targets learners starting out or at intermediate levels.

- Mixed difficulty courses attract the highest average enrollments (~133k students per course), followed by Beginner (~81k).
Students prefer flexible courses that cover multiple skill levels or are easy to start.

- Beginner and Mixed courses have the highest average ratings (4.68 and 4.71 respectively), while Advanced courses have slightly lower ratings (4.6).
Simpler or more accessible courses tend to satisfy students more.

- There is almost no correlation between course rating and number of students enrolled (correlation ~0.07).
This means other factors—like course topic, institution, or marketing—likely drive popularity more than ratings.
